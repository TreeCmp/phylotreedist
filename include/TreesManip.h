     * @brief The method returns a new tree with the topology of input tree, but with
     * nodes ids ordered in the following way (lNum = number_of_leaves) :
     * \n  - the ids [ 0 .. lNum-1 ] are given to leaves in the alphabetical order of their names
     * \n  - the ids [ lNum .. tree.numberOfNodes-1 ] are given arbitrary to internal nodes
     * 
     * \n\nThe ordering method assures that if two trees with the same leaves sets are ordered,
     * their leaves have the same ids.
     * \n\n time complexity: O(n logn)
     * @param trIn - the tree which topology will have the new ordered tree.
     * @returns a pointer to new tree with the same topology as the input has and with ordered leaves.
